====================
Applying for an ISSN
====================

An ISSN is critical for journals who want to be indexed, add DOIs, and be apart of the greater research ecosystem. This documentation
includes helpful information for getting a DOI.

Mockups
-------

ISSN applications for new journals often require a mockup.  The mock up should include:

* A page showing the title of the publication (cover, title page, title screen, main menu)
* A page showing the name of the publisher and the place of publication (masthead, copyright statement, "About Us," "Contact Us") in the Roman alphabet.
* Contents of publication (articles)
