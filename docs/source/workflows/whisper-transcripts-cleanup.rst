Cleaning a Whisper Transcript
==========================

Whisper AI will generate transcripts with a variety of flaws and issues. However, to save time, prioritize fixing certain issues over others.

---------------------
Goals for Cleanup
---------------------

* Whisper transcripts should be as accurate to the audio as possible. No additions or omissions.
* Whisper transcripts should be readable. Grammar should be accurate enough so that it is understandable without audio and can be read.
* Whisper transcripts should be searchable. It is expected that users will search for specific keywords such as the name of a person or the title of a work. Therefore, these names should be spelled correctly.

How to clean a transcript
---------------------

* Remove all hallucinations. Hallucinations can be identified by blocks of red text.
* Fill in omissions. This can be done either by listening to the audio and transcribing by hand or by splicing together multiple AI-generated transcripts. If you do the latter, document where you added text and what file you pulled your addition from.
* Capitalize proper names and beginnings of sentences.
* Add puntuation as needed, especially periods and punctuation used within the title of a work.
* Make sure the following are spelled correctly: Names of individuals, places, organizations, events, groups, works. This includes fictional varieties of each (ie characters, fictional organizations, imaginary places).
* Whatever else may be relevant depending on the collection, what it emphasizes, and how users are expected to interact with it.

---------------------
Things not to prioritize due to time constraints
---------------------

* Standardizing spelling of words with regional varieties.
* Adding commas, semicolons, and other punctuation that are not required for the transcript to be understood.
* Ensuring common connecting words are accurate (ie "and" versus "then" when the transcript makes sense with either).

------------------
Things to NOT do
------------------

* Removing filler words like "uh" and "um" unless they are so often used, the transcript becomes difficult to read.
* Correcting the grammar of the speaker or otherwise changing the transcript.
* Correcting misquoted/misremembered titles, names of individuals, concepts, quotations from elsewhere (just make a note for the metadata).
* Censoring words (just make a note of harmful language for the metadata).
* Removing parts of the transcript deemed "unnecessary" such as commercials or off-script chatter.
