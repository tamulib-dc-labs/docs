The Digital Library Program of Texas A&M University is made up of many microservices and applications. This document
attempts to define the various applications in use by the Libraries, how they are used, and where. To keep things simple,
this document will only include applications that are considered a part of the digital library program. As a result, data
repository services and applications such as Vireo will be ignored.

OAKTrust and the Institutional Repository
-----------------------------------------

Our institutional repository, `OAKTrust <https://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu>`_, is delivered using DSPACE. The use of
DSPACE at TAMU goes back several decades and has always been the primary repository system used by the Libraries. The
repository is divided into communities, subcommunities, collections, and subcollections. Until very recently, DSPACE did
not have any real support for content models or work types.  Instead, it was designed to be structurally agnostic and focused
on managing workflows, groups, and users related to collections of objects. As this evolved, other things occurred such
as DSPACE requiring a collection to be tied to a specific content model. The effects of this can be seen across our various
collections and communities.

OAKTrust primarily consists of traditional institutional repository content: ETDs, preprints, post-prints, and grey
literature. There is a mix of mediated and unmediated workflows largely tied to the origins of the collection.  Historically,
there has been no MOUs, MOAs, or user agreements, so expectations of the Libraries and users can vary wildly without
much context. The repository has also been thought of as a preservation resource and place of deposit for actively
published resources. This creates challenges for the Libraries as we approach ADA Title II. More information regarding
the thinking behind OAKTrust can be seen in the `OAKTrust Policies <https://library.tamu.edu/services/scholarly_communication/deposit/guidelines.php>`_
page.

While DSPACE is primarily thought of as the institutional repository, it does much more. In fact, over 30,000 works,
many of which are things you would expect to find in a cultural heritage repository, are deposited in the
`University Libraries <https://library.tamu.edu/services/scholarly_communication/deposit/guidelines.php>`_
community. Normally, but not always, these works will be discoverable through something like SAGE as DSPACE historically
wasn't designed to deliver cultural heritage collections.
