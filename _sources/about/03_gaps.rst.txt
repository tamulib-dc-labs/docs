No True Concept of Work Type or File Type
-----------------------------------------

The concept of work types, or content models, is mostly missing from the digital library program. As a result, things
aren't always optimal, options are often limited, and software dictates where content is deposited. In my opinion, this
goes back to the historic adoption of DSPACE and the fact it was historically devoid of content model. This continued on
in the adoption of Fedora and how PCDM was initially implemented.  For instance, all works has the concept of pages even
if a work is made of one file.  Similarly, files are only differentiable via mime type. Therefore, a PDF would always
be treated the same regardless of its actual purpose.
