==================================================================
Policy and Procedure for Captioning and Transcription of A/V Works
==================================================================

-------
Purpose
-------

This policy establishes procedures for providing accessibility and discoverability features for audiovisual (A/V) works,
including video and audio-only materials. It ensures consistent application of closed captioning, diarization,
downloadable transcripts, and navigable transcripts. The goal is to improve access, mitigate risk, and provide a baseline
of accessibility recognizing that all files will be initially generated by AI technologies and that we may not have the
resources or ability to clean up everything.

------------------
Guiding Principles
------------------

1. **Accessibility First**: We should provide the most inclusive experience possible within available resources.
2. **Pragmatism**: AI-generated captions and transcripts will contain errors, but they represent an important first step toward accessibility and compliance.
3. **Transparency**: Users should be aware that captions and transcripts are auto-generated and may contain inaccuracies.
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Even imperfect captions and transcripts reduce institutional risk by demonstrating a proactive commitment to accessibility.
5. **Collection Context**: Different types of collections may receive different levels of captioning and transcript cleanup, depending on their significance, use, and other political factors
