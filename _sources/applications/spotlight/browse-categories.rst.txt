Creating a Browse Category in Spotlight
===============================

You may want to to organize a large collection on Spotlight by dividing it into smaller categories people can browse. Browse categories allow for users to browse through only a specific segment of the collection determined by the curator.

----------------------
Make Browse Categories Visible
----------------------

First you must make sure browse categories show up as a menu option for viewers. To do this, go to the dashboard (can be located by going to the homepage and replacing "home" "dashboard" in the url). 

Under "Configuration", click on "Appearance" and go to the "Main Menu" tab. Make sure the "Browse" box is checked.

----------------------
Add tags to digital objects
----------------------

You will need to first add tags to items you want to include in a category. To add a tag, edit the item and scroll down to the "exhibit tags" metadata field. Type whatever you want the tag to be. Keep in mind that tag will be visible to users. If you have already assigned that tag to another item, it should autocomplete. Also note that an item can have multiple tags.

Add the same tag to every item you want to have in a certain browse category.

----------------------
Create a Browse Category
----------------------

Now that you have all the relevant items tagged, go to the dashboard. Under "Curation", select "Tags". Scroll to the tag you wish to create a category for. Click "view". This should open the search results for the tag.

Click on "save this search" and enter a title to create a new saved search. This will be the title of the new browse category. If you are updating an existing category, select it from the dropdown menu.

Go back to the dashboard. Under "Curation", select "Browse." Make sure the box next to the browse category you created is checked. This will make the category show up on the "Browse" page.


----------------------
Adding a thumbnail
----------------------

To add a thumbnail, choose a digital object from the relevant browse category. Copy its IIIF manifest. Go to the `IIIF Manifest Editor <https://manifest-editor.digirati.services/?tab=examples>`_. Click on "Open Manifest URL" and paste the manifest link. Save any image (canvas) from the dashboard.

On Spotlight's dashboard, go back to "Curation" under "Browse". Go to the relevant browse category and click "Edit". Go to the "thumbnail" tab and select the "upload an image" option. Upload the image you just saved and readjust the size in the cropping tool.

Note that you cannot use IIIF for a thumbnail. They must be uploaded from the computer.
