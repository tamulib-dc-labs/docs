Creating and Modifying Exhibits
===============================

The Libraries currently uses Spotlight for exhibit curation.  This document will explain how to create a new exhibit
with the features that are currently in use.

----------
Navigation
----------
On Spotlight and Spotlight Pre it is easiest to move between editing the homepage and the exhibit settings through changing the URL.

For example: `https://spotlight-pre.library.tamu.edu/spotlight/william-fairfax-gray-diary/home <https://spotlight-pre.library.tamu.edu/spotlight/william-fairfax-gray-diary/home>`_ will get you to the homepage. But `https://spotlight-pre.library.tamu.edu/spotlight/william-fairfax-gray-diary/dashboard <https://spotlight-pre.library.tamu.edu/spotlight/william-fairfax-gray-diary/dashboard>`_ will get you to the dashboard.

Use this "home" and "dashboard" pattern for all exhibits.

----------------------
Item and Item Curation
----------------------

To import an item, you must use IIIF. While on the dashboard, go to the sidebar where it says "Items". Go to "Add items", then "IIIF URL". The IIIF manifest should come from either OAKTrust or Fedora. Do not try to directly upload from the desktop, not even for the thumbnail and banner. It will not work.

A link from Fedora will look like this:

* https://api.library.tamu.edu/iiif-service/fedora/presentation/3b/6f/c3/25/3b6fc325-f6ca-41d8-b91e-8c5db3be8c13/graydiary-saf_objects/2

A link from OAKTrust will look like this: 

* https://api-pre.library.tamu.edu/iiif-service/dspace/presentation/1969.1/1591357

You may also edit one of these manifests and upload to `custom-iiif-manifests <https://github.com/tamulib-dc-labs/custom-iiif-manifests>`_. This hosts the edited manifest on GitHub. The link will look like this:

* https://tamulib-dc-labs.github.io/custom-iiif-manifests/manifests/gray-diary/graydiary.json

Manifest Editing
----------------

To ensure that a multi-page item embedded in the Spotlight exhibit has its pages appear in pairs like a book or magazine, add the following code under the :code:`sequences` element.

* :code:`"viewingHint": "paged"`.
